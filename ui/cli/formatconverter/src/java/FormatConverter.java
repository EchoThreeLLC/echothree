/**
 * http://jroller.com/page/mlconnor?entry=java_character_encoding_conversion
 *
 * Most people won't care about character encoding/decoding
 * in Java until it bites them. CSV files that are created
 * on Windows from Excel for example are stored in the
 * Windows standard CP1252 encoding. Using these files on
 * your Linux machine in production may produce exceptions
 * and otherwise nasty results as your Linux machine probably
 * won't have CP1252 encoding. Doing it on the fly isn't an
 * option without the encoding so the best solution I came
 * up with is just a Java program to read in one encoding and
 * write out another.
 *
 * This program will take a file of one encoding and
 * convert it to a file with another encoding.  Both
 * encodings are provided on the command line.  Keep
 * in mind that there is no good way to detect an
 * encoding so this code trusts that you are providing
 * the correct input encoding.
 *
 * Also note that not every platform comes with all of
 * the encodings that you may need.  Whether or not
 * a platform will have the encoding you provide is
 * completely dependent on that platform.  Java comes
 * with a few standard encodings such as UTF-8.
