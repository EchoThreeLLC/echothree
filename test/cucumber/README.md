# About the Cucumber Tests

The Cucumber test suite is not functioning correctly at this time under
JDK 11. An exception is throw when it's searching jars, a solution has
not been found at this time. I've tried narrowing it to just jars that
are required by Cucumber, but that hasn't been successful either.
